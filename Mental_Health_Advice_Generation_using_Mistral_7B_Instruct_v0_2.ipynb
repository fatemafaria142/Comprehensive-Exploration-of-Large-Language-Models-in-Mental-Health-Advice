            "Response: Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC\n",

When I work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem. I generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening  self esteem, by guiding my client with CBT practices. CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave. CBT is good for individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self esteem, codependency, etc.\n",

Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone.\\xa0Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it\\'s hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it\\'s place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism.\\xa0Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don\\'t have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you.\\xa0There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them.\\xa0As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741.\\xa0I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions.\\xa0Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC</s>'"

              "\"<s><s> [INST] Put yourself in the shoes of a thoughtful mental health counselor. Imagine you're all set to help with kindness and understanding, ready to offer care and support. Your task is to extend understanding and guidance, providing support to individuals dealing with mental health challenges. Here is my mental health problems: I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here. I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it. How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone? [/INST] I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time and feeling worthless. I want you to know that I understand that this is a painful and difficult experience, and I'm here to support you in any way I can.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it's important to recognize that feelings of worthlessness are a common experience for many people, and you're not alone in this. It's important to remember that our thoughts and feelings are not always a reflection of reality, and that everyone has intrinsic value and worth.\\n\\nHowever, I also understand that this may feel like a challenging idea to believe right now. If you're open to exploring some potential ways to help shift your thinking and improve your mood, here are a few suggestions:\\n\\n1. Challenge your thoughts: You mentioned that you spend a lot of time thinking about feeling worthless. It may be helpful to start noticing when these thoughts arise and challenging them with evidence. For example, write down three things that you've accomplished in the past week, no matter how small they may seem. Reflect on the things you have to offer and the value that you bring to others' lives.\\n2. Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself physically can help improve your mood and overall sense of well-being. Try to establish a consistent sleep routine, eat nutritious foods, engage in regular physical activity, and avoid alcohol and other substances that can negatively impact your mood.\\n3. Connect with others: Reach out to trusted friends or family members for support. Often, just talking about what you're experiencing can help alleviate feelings of isolation and worthlessness. If you're not comfortable talking to someone you know, there are also many helpful resources and support groups available online.\\n4. Consider seeking professional help: If your feelings of worthlessness persist despite your efforts to improve your mood, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional. They can provide you with evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or medication, to help you manage your symptoms and develop more positive ways of thinking.\\n5. Practice self-compassion: Try to be kind and understanding with yourself, just as you would with a friend going through a similar experience. Validate your feelings and remind yourself that it's okay to have difficult thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nRemember that changing your thinking and improving your mood takes time and effort, and there may be ups and downs along the way. But with support, self-care, and a commitment to making small steps towards change, you can make progress and begin to feel more worthwhile and valued. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.</s>\""

            "Firstly, it's important to remember that having anxiety in response to driving is a real and valid concern, regardless of what others may think. It sounds like you have a very fearful reaction to this experience. If you feel comfortable, you could try sharing your concerns about how your family reacts with a mental health professional. They may be able to offer you some suggestions about how to approach the situation with them, or even work with you to learn strategies for managing your anxiety around driving.\n",

It may be helpful to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, before getting into a car or while driving. You might also consider seeking out cognitive behavioral therapy. This is a type of psychotherapy that can help you identify and challenge the thoughts and beliefs that fuel your anxiety. Over time, it may be helpful to gradually challenge yourself to spend more time in the car and practice relaxation skills, perhaps with the support of a mental health professional.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, it's important to focus on self-care during this difficult time. Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and finding ways to engage in enjoyable activities. Try to connect with friends and loved ones as much as possible and discuss your feelings with them. It can help to know that you're not alone in your struggles, and that others can offer support and understanding.\n",

            "I wish you all the best in your efforts to overcome this anxiety. It's not easy to face such fears, but with the right support and effort, it's possible to make progress.

It's natural to feel helpless, alone and out of control when dealing with self-harm. Self-harm can be a way for people to cope with emotional pain, sadness, and other difficult emotions. It's important to understand that self-harm is not a character flaw, a sign of weakness, or a choice.

It's important to keep in mind that these are not quick fixes, but rather, ongoing practices that can help you when you feel the urge to self-harm.\n",

Belonging is an important aspect of mental health and well-being. It's not uncommon for someone to feel disconnected or not completely accepted, even when they do have loving support from others. It's important to explore why you might be feeling this way, and to start by being kind to yourself about this experience. Some questions to consider might be: What are the specific feelings that come up for you when you're with people or in a social setting? Does it feel different in certain situations or with certain people? What might be contributing to these feelings? Are there any specific thoughts or beliefs that come up for you during or after these interactions that might be reinforcing the feelings? Are there any past experiences or relationships that might be contributing to your feelings now?\n",

In any case, I'd be happy to provide additional support or guidance as you explore these questions and consider any practical steps you could be taking to help build a stronger sense of belonging for yourself.</s>\n"
