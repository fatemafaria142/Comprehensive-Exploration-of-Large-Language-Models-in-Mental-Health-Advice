# Comprehensive Exploration of Large Language Models in Mental Health Advice

## Dataset: Mental Health Counseling Conversations

This dataset is a valuable collection of questions and answers sourced from two prominent online counseling and therapy platforms. It consists of 3.51k rows, with questions spanning a wide range of mental health topics. Qualified psychologists provide insightful answers, making it an ideal resource for fine-tuning language models to enhance their capability in providing mental health advice.

### Data Fields
- **Context:** A string containing the question asked by a user.
- **Response:** A string containing the corresponding answer provided by a psychologist.

## LangChain Framework:

This is a framework specifically designed to simplify building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
It provides tools for:
Context-awareness: Connecting LLMs to various sources of context, like prompts, examples, and relevant content, for more informed responses.
Reasoning: Enabling LLMs to reason about provided information and take appropriate actions based on that reasoning.
Composable Chains: Building complex application logic by chaining together smaller LLM interactions and other components.
